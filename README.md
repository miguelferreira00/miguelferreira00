## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a university student at @FCUL with a passion for technology and coding. Currently, I'm diving deep into various programming languages and exploring different areas of computer science.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my knowledge in machine learning and data science.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced algorithms and software development methodologies.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and hackathons.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to programming, algorithms, or technology in general!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy experimenting with new programming languages in my free time!
- Known programming languages: Python, C, Prolog, Assembly RISC-V, Java
